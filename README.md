* If you don't want to install Package Control you can simply clone the repository inside the "Package directory"
	1. Go in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
	2. Clone the git repo : git clone https://github.com/DempaPower/SublimTek.git

## Usage

* First, for every C file you want to use this plugin with you need to activate the "Epitech" mode
	1. Open your file
	2. Open the Command Palette
	3. Select "SublimTek: Activate Epitech mode"
* Then, each time the file is saved, it will be indented according like it would be with the classic Emacs
* If you want to stop the "Epitech" mode
	1. Go to your file
	2. Open the Command Palette
	3. Select "SublimTek : Deactivate Epitech mode"
